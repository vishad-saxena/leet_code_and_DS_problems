"""
A re-implementation of the second step in the seam carving algorithm: finding
the lowest-energy seam in an image. In this version of the algorithm, not only
is the energy value of the seam determined, but it's possible to reconstruct the
entire seam from the top to the bottom of the image.

The function you fill out in this module will be used as part of the overall
seam carving process. If you run this module in isolation, the lowest-energy
seam will be visualized:

        in a 2D grid this object appears.

      - Also stores the x-coordinate for the pixel in the previous row that led
        to this particular seam energy. This is the back pointer from which the

    This is the second version of the seam finding algorithm. In addition to
    storing and finding the lowest-energy value of any seam, you will also store
    back pointers used to reconstruct the lowest-energy seam.

    At the end, you will return a list of x-coordinates where you would have
    returned a single x-coordinate instead.
